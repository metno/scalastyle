This is a very simple wrapper around the scalastyle batch program,
found at http://www.scalastyle.org/

It provides two things:

  * A shell script for easier calling
  * Creation of a debian package for easy standardized installation.

Building:

$ autoreconf -i && ./configure && make 

Installing:

$ sudo make install

Creating debian package:

$ make debian
